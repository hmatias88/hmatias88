I am an aspiring python developer and data scientist looking into transitioning into the tech sector. In my previous life, I was working as a Structural Engineer with a side hobby in currency/stock trading.

In this account I have included a few of my projects that I have been working on.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled on a Data Science bootcamp with HyperionDev learning Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Git. I'm very excited about this!
